![Montagem_SOM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84215eb3-c3e6-4854-a75a-87d1debace4f)

## Project description
The objective of this project is to apply kohonen maps (popularly known as self-organizing maps - SOM) for unsupervised classification of photosphere spectropolarization data obtained by SOT-SP of the HINODE mission.

## Funcionalities
### - Loading HINODE mission data.
### - Generating spectral and polarization images.
### - Training the neural network (SOM).
### - Application of the neural network (SOM).

## Download data
- The High Altitude Observatory (HAO) of the National Center for Atmospheric research (NCAR).
