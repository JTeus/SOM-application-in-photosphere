# SOM application in photosphere

## Project description
The objective of this project is to apply kohonen maps (popularly known as self-organizing maps - SOM) for unsupervised classification of photosphere spectropolarization data obtained by SOT-SP of the HINODE mission.

## Funcionalities
### - Loading HINODE mission data.
### - Generating spectral and polarization images.
### - Training the neural network (SOM).
### - Application of the neural network (SOM).
